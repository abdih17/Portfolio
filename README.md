# Portfolio
Working on a professional portfolio that incorporates mobile-first and responsive design practices.

##User Stories:

As a developer...
  - I want the web page to be aesthetically pleasing to look at, so that my skill-sets are displayed.
  - I want the page to incorporate responsive design principals, so that it is accessible to a variety end users.
  - I want the additional JavaScript features to enhance (not overwhelm) the web page so that the user can find the necessary information they need/want.

As an end-user...
  - I want to navigate through the page smoothly.
  - I want professional design that conveys the developer's skills.
  - I want to be able to contact the developer, so that I can offer the developer a potential job. :)
